## About the project

<p>
This project was the result of a need of mine. I was in need of something to help me stay organized, 
but I wanted to make my own tool, so I did it here.
This is only the beginning of the journey, but I must confess that I am very excited
</p>

<p>
The main technologies used here were Laravel (obviously), VueJs as the main framework
JavaScript frontend, TailwindCSS as a CSS framework, Heroicons and Jetstream for authentication
